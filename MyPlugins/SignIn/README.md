A plug-in that a password protects *MusicStream* by hijacking the *get* and *post* requests.

The default password is *Pass*. There is as of now no easy way to change it =P.
If you want to change the password you need to run the *saltHashPassword* function with your password as the argument. Then you need to replace the values in the *passHash* object.
